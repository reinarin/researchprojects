The REU program is a National Science Foundation sponsored research opportunity for City University of New York (CUNY) undergraduate students who are interested in a rich research experience and who are willing to pursue graduate education in the geosciences. The goals of the REU program are to: 1) provide a rich and comprehensive research experience in satellite and ground-based remote sensing; 2) support students to pursue careers in STEM by exposing them to research at the undergraduate level; and 3) inspire students to acquired advanced STEM degrees. REU Scholars will receive hands-on research exposure under the mentorship of faculty who are experts in the geosciences.
